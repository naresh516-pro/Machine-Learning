### Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and a single independent variable (predictor). The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (regression line) through the data points that minimizes the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.

The general formula for simple linear regression is:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon \]

- \( y \) is the dependent variable (what you are trying to predict).
- \( x \) is the independent variable (the predictor).
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept of the regression line.
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope of the regression line, representing the change in \( y \) for a one-unit change in \( x \).
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term, accounting for the variability in \( y \) that cannot be explained by \( x \).

This method is commonly used in predictive analytics and helps in understanding the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
